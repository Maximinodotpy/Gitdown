⚠️ This plugin is still in development. If you find any issues, don't hesitate to report them.

## 🎈 Easy to use
Setting Gitdown up to work with your Repository and Glob Pattern takes no time and can be easily changed anytime.

## 🔨 Customization
The shape of your Repository does not matter, you can change the glob pattern to your liking, and it will understand your repo correctly.

## 🎁 100% Free
Gitdown is free, and you can use it for whatever you want. Of course, I would be very grateful if you link back to me or the plugin so more people know about it 😀.
